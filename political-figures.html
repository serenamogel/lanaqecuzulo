He helped prevent Quebec from separating from the rest of Canada in 1980 and championed a new constitution for the country, which greatly advanced Canadians’ civil rights.

His mother, Grace Elliott, was of both French and Scottish descent, so Trudeau and his two siblings grew up speaking both French and English. His family was quite wealthy by the time he was a teenager, as his father, a businessman and lawyer named Charles-Emile Trudeau, had sold his gas station business to Imperial Oil some years prior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from the elite Jesuit preparatory school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, Trudeau went on to receive a law degree from the University of Montreal. He earned a master’s degree from Harvard University and also studied at the London School of Economics and the Ecole des Science Politiques in Paris.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shortly after graduating, he landed a position as a desk officer for the Privy Council. From 1951 to 1961, he practiced law, specializing in labor and civil liberty cases, issues he would later bring into focus for all of Canada.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1961, he joined the staff of the University of Montreal as a professor of constitutional law. Four years later, Liberal Party leaders were searching for potential candidates. Trudeau and two of his colleagues were invited to run for party seats. All three men won in the election that year; Trudeau became Minister of Justice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">His flamboyant and charismatic personality meshed well with the changing attitudes and opinions of the late 1960s. Within a year, he had reformed the divorce laws and liberalized the laws on abortion and homosexuality.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 title="Prime Minister of Canada" data-anchor-id=prime-minister-of-canada class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Prime Minister of Canada</h2><img alt="pierre trudeau speaks at a podium, he wears a dark suit with a red rose on his lapel" title="Pierre Trudeau speaks at a podium" width=1024 height=646 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pierre-trudeau-the-prime-minister-of-canada-making-an-news-photo-1691011212.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Pierre Trudeau served as the prime minister of Canada from 1968 to 1984.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When Canada’s then-prime minister Lester B. Pearson announced his plans to retire in 1967, Trudeau campaigned for leadership of the Liberal Party. His ideas were popular, and on April 6, 1968, he won the post. His election as prime minister benefited from an unprecedented wave of youth involvement. “Trudeaumania,” as it was called, was the nickname given to the excitement brought on by throngs of teenagers who supported Trudeau. Within 20 days of winning leadership of his party, 48-year-old Trudeau was sworn in as Canada’s 15th prime minister.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trudeau’s time in office started off with a bang. As soon as he was elected, he began fighting for universal health care. He also worked to reform governmental caucus meetings to make them more efficient. He also made headlines for his personal life, dating the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/barbra-streisand data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbra Streisand" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbra Streisand</a> before marrying the much younger Margaret Sinclair in 1971.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beyond his hip image, Trudeau had to lead his country through numerous challenges. The 1970 October Crisis tested his stance against terrorists. The crisis began when Quebec separatist group kidnapped a Quebec official and a British trade commissioner. To deal with this situation, Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act, giving the government overarching power to arrest without trial. On domestic matters, he championed the official implementation of bilingualism.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Losing his post in 1979, Trudeau served as the opposition leader for several months. He was back in power the following year, and he became the leading force against the 1980 referendum to give Quebec sovereignty. He helped keep Quebec part of Canada by defeating this initiative.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trudeau also sought to officially and completely separate Canada from <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/royalty/queen-elizabeth-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Queen Elizabeth II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Queen Elizabeth II</a>’s Britain. He accomplished this goal with the 1982 Constitution Act for Canada. This monumental act brought about new and widespread civil rights for all Canadians. After 16 years as prime minister, Trudeau retired from politics in 1984.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 title="Wife and Children" data-anchor-id=wife-and-children class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Wife and Children</h2><img alt="pierre trudeau smiles while leaning against a large boulder, his sons justin, alexandre and michel sit on the boulder, justin smiles at the camera, alexandre has a slight smile and michel looks directly at camera, pierre wears a wool sweater and the boys wear zipup jackets" title="Pierre Trudeau with sons Justin, Alexandre, and Michel in 1980﻿" width=1024 height=649 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/canadian-prime-minister-pierre-e-trudeau-joins-sons-justin-news-photo-1691010885.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Pierre Trudeau with his sons Justin, Alexandre, and Michel in 1980</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Trudeau was a well-known bachelor in his first years as prime minister, dating actors such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/barbra-streisand data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barbra Streisand" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Barbra Streisand</a> and Margot Kidder.
