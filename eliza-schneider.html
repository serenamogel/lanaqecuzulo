Her father was a math and drama teacher at the School of Arts High School in Rochester, New York, where she graduated as salutatorian. Her mother was an attorney for the reservation. She started playing violin, learning the Suzuki method, after seeing El Shenkar. When she was sixteen, she was in her first musical group, IT’S MY PARTY! From ages 7–20, she went to Jewish summer camp, becoming a counselor, and started performing on stage. By the time she was in the fourth grade she began writing and performing her own plays, because the teacher told her that she would only be allowed to stage a play if she “wrote, produced, directed.” Four years later she was chosen for a part in Annie; Schneider’s parents would not let her tour with the troupe after being cast. She participated in a theater program at Northwestern University’s National High School Institute and graduated from UCLA as a world arts and cultures major.</p><p>When explaining about her dialect and musical interest she said; “You know how they talk about a photographic memory? That’s not actually how my mind works. It’s aural. I remember what I hear…when I try to do a piece onstage, I hear the next words [they actually said]. I hear the rest of the monologue. It takes every bit of strength and intellect that I have to control that.” In a 2013 interview she explained that “to me, music, voice, voices of the people, play writing, dialect, language, violin – it all springs from the same well of fascination with sound.”</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Eliza Schneider ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

During her research into accents, she “visited all the English-speaking countries in the world, conducting more than 7,000 interviews over all.” From the interviews she created a one-woman show called Freedom of Speech in which she tells the stories of 34 people in their voices. The various quotes are combined into a story. When interviewed about the shows by Western Washington University newspaper The Western Front, she explained that “People in America today are scared to speak up and tell their perspective on what our nation is or where it is going… I wanted to repeat the peoples’ words verbatim so the audience could develop their own perspective.” Using a semi-autobiographical approach, Schneider links the quotes and stories together, saying “it’s really a love story about a petulant girl who starts out hating America for perpetuating hate. She begins collecting sounds and winds up falling in love with her country.” The show won the 2003 New York International Fringe Festival award for “Best Solo Show”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Eliza Schneider height</b> Not available right now.
