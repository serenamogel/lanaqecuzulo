At cold temperatures, these reactions are slow and at warm temperatures they are fast. These chemical reactions are optimal at body temperatures are between 70 - 90 degrees Farenheit. Below 60 degrees Farenheit, snakes become sluggish. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What temperature do snakes like the most?</h2>The most important thing to remember is that reptiles are cold-blooded animals.
