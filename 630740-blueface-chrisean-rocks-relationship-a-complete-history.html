Whether it was <a href=# class=text-word rel>Madonna</a> and Sean Penn, Britney and K-Fed, <a href=# rel>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard</a>, or Pammy and Tommy, this trope has been a staple of the celebrity gossip mill for as long as we can remember. And admittedly, hip-hop is by no means exempt from gravitating towards these dynamics.</p><p>Over the years, fans have gawked at <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Amber Rose</a>’s explosive, post-break up mudslinging, looked on with horror at the reports from within <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nas</a> and Kelis’ marriage and, due to the dawning of the&nbsp; Love & Hip-Hop era, been glued to the screen as the likes of Safaree and Erica Mena imploded on camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Across every generation, there is one such couple who, for whatever reason, become a benchmark for toxicity and for the modern day hip-hop fan, that dubious title goes to none other than Blueface and Chrisean Rock.&nbsp;</p><p>Between allegations of infidelity, public spectacles and <a href=# rel>the violence that they’ve perpetrated against not just one another</a>, but their significant others’ families, there is truly no good reason why they should still be together. Except, the most likely answer: publicity.&nbsp;</p><p>From fist-fights to paternity suits, there’s been plenty of twists and turns on the road to the two supposedly tying the knot in <a href=# rel>Blueface’s new video for "Dear Rock."</a> Here, we’re going to break down the bizarre encounters that have defined the relationship between the stars of the tumultuous Crazy In Love and try to establish where it all began to go wrong.</p><p>ATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 04: ChriseanRock and Blueface attend Goliath Aftershock at Lyfe Nightclub on September 4, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><span><h2 id=h-2020-blueface-and-chrisean-meet>2020: Blueface and Chrisean Meet<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2></span><p>Although it may feel like you’ve been reading headlines pertaining to the two for a lifetime now, the couple first crossed paths three short years ago. In that era of his career, Blueface, who was first catapulted to fame by tracks such as “Thotiana” and “Bleed It,” <a href=# rel>was plowing most of his efforts into his OnlyFans</a> account after his debut album, Find The Beat, didn’t perform the way that he nor Cash Money intended.&nbsp;</p><p>As his renown as a social media creator rose and his stock as a rapper decreased, Blueface launched an Onlyfans reality show known as Blue Girls Club in which women would compete for his affections. From the outset, Chrisean was one of the frontrunners for the competition and in their first ever meeting, Rock, who was a former division 1 athlete, immediately seemed enamored with him. As others seemed to be nonplussed by his introductions, Rock immediately asked to hug him.</p><p>Never one to shy away from throwing down with her fellow competitors,&nbsp; Chrisean, who has also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared on Ultimate Tag and </a>Baddies South, quickly became the star due to the sheer amount of drama she was embroiled in. Sure enough, she won the show, while losing her front tooth in the process, and later obtained a contract to make music under the Blueface LLC Imprint.</p><span><h2 id=h-february-2022-chrisean-arrested-for-stealing-blueface-s-car>February 2022: Chrisean Arrested For Stealing Blueface’s Car</h2></span><p>After the show wrapped, Chrisean and Blueface’s connection seemingly deepened far beyond what the cameras saw. On top of collaborating together on tracks such as “Lonely,” all reports suggested that the pair were engaged in a committed relationship. But right from the start, turbulence wasn’t far away.</p><p>On Valentines Day 2022, Chrisean Rock was arrested in Oklahoma on charges of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, and receiving, possessing and concealing a stolen vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>As the news broke, Blueface would take to IG to reveal that the vehicle in question was his G Wagon.</p><p>“B**** stole my car [and] thought she was gone drive to Baltimore 25 hrs away. Dumbass,” he wrote on his IG story. “A thief is the worst thing you can be as a female. I’d have more respect for a prostitute…talm bout some ‘come bail me out.’”</p><p>A move that gained her the ire of Blueface’s manager Wack 100– who labeled her “a bozo”– the rapper later revealed that he initially didn’t know that Chrisean was the assailant until he got home and released that she’d unsettlingly written the words “I Love Blue” on a wall in her own blood. Considering that she already had multiple tattoos to the rapper emblazoned on her skin, it didn’t take long to work out who’d stolen the vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time of the incident, Chrisean was reportedly trying to head back to her hometown of Baltimore, with a text exchange citing that her mother needed help. Afterwards, Rock, who is one of 11 siblings, revealed to NoJumper that she was in a bad place mentally at the time of the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>“I used this time to really heal, I’m just healing from a lot of sh*t," she said in an interview from jail. “A lotta stuff I be telling y’all, but I don’t be tellin’ y’all everything, so, you know how that go.”&nbsp;While these remarks would suggest that she was on a positive trajectory, it wouldn’t take long before their dysfunctional love affair took another dark step.</p><span><h2 id=h-may-2022-chrisean-hits-blueface-s-mom>May 2022: Chrisean Hits Blueface’s Mom</h2></span><p>It’s a common cliche that some people don’t get along with their in-laws and will avoid seeing them at all costs. In Chrisean’s case, it was clear that she wasn’t too worried about the impression she left on Blueface’s mother. In May&nbsp;of 2022, it was reported that Rock, real name Chrisean Malone,&nbsp;had struck the rapper's mom and sister. By way of confirming the incident, his mother posted a picture of the aftermath which showed her to have a swollen face.&nbsp;</p><p>“All I know is my son will never bring that person around my family ever again in life and that’s all that matters. Carry on.” According to Blueface’s mother, real name Klarissa Safford, she would never move past the incident. While on Chrisean’s part, she expressed a degree of remorse, but insists that her hand was forced.&nbsp;</p><p>“Why talk s**t knowing u threw glass jars at my face and called my mom a dope fiend n got in my face like I wont put u down?” She said on IG. “nobody happy to put they hands on somebody moma but I’m not a bitch so be careful."</p><p>Unfortunately for everyone involved, the violence didn’t stop there.&nbsp;</p><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 03: Chrisean Rock attends Normal Culture presents: Evolutionary Inception Fashion Show hosted by Winnie Stackz on February 03, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Victoria Sirakova/Getty Images)</p><span><h2 id=h-july-2022-chrisean-attacks-blueface>July 2022: Chrisean Attacks Blueface<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2></span><p>In what would become the first in a string of supposed instances of domestic abuse between the two, July 2022, Chrisean was seen attacking Blueface on a Hollywood sidewalk before his security intervened and pinned Chrisean to the ground. While others may interpret that as a sign to reassess the relationship, the pair persevered and by the very next month, Rock would be arrested for punching the crip-affiliated MC once again.&nbsp;</p><p>After she was apprehended, Blueface took to Instagram to attempt to stem the flow of controversy, claiming that the arrest was on account of trespassing rather than their altercation. Interestingly, he didn’t actually deny that blows had been exchanged, remarking on IG live that Chrisean packs a hell of&nbsp;punch as she revealed that “she hit me with a banger. I was like, oooh!!!"</p><p>At this point, Blueface was on the receiving end of the assaults. But before long, he’d be dishing them out on his own accord.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 id=h-september-2022-blueface-fights-chrisean-s-dad>September 2022: Blueface Fights Chrisean's Dad</h2></span><p>In September of 2022, Blueface and the Malone family gathered at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chrisean’s native Baltimore. Unbeknownst to the staff at the plush location, some bad blood had accumulated between them. After Chrisean’s father sought to reprimand Blueface for supposedly putting his hands on her, her long estranged father threw a punch at LA native who didn’t hesitate to respond in kind. Once the melee ensued, it was reported that Blueface, who previously competed Bareknuckle Fighting Championships, came out a winner, leaving her father unconscious.&nbsp;</p><p>“So my boyfriend knocked my dad out," Chrisean later said on social media. “Da family stuff didn’t go well, ion even know what’s going on.”&nbsp;</p><p>In an effort to further defend Blueface, Chrisean divulged details about the fractious dynamic between herself and her biological father, insisting that due to his misdeeds, he had it coming.&nbsp;</p><p>“The same dad [that] got knocked out was the same guy that tied my mama up in da woods just to beat her cause she scream so loud in the house when he beat her in front of us,” she proclaimed&nbsp; in a since-deleted tweet. “So he went out his way to damage my whole family, that same dad I met when I was seven. Somebody was supposed to knock n***a out a long time ago.”</p><span><h2 id=h-october-2022-chrisean-claims-blueface-attacked-her>October 2022: Chrisean Claims Blueface Attacked Her&nbsp;</h2></span><p>In abusive relationships, sometimes the violence&nbsp; that occurs is shielded from view for a long time. While Chrisean’s shocking&nbsp; willingness to assault Blueface had been a matter of public record for some time, there had been no indication that he would inflict damage himself. During an IG live appearance in October of 2022, Chrisean suggested that Blueface had assaulted her.&nbsp;</p><p>"The f**k. This is a busted lip. A busted nose," she said while showing her lacerations.&nbsp;At the time, Chrisean purported the injuries as a response to Blueface flying off the handle after she texted another guy. However, just one day later, she walked back the claims and laid the blame for the bruising with a much&nbsp;more outlandish story.&nbsp;</p><p>“No filter, no make-up. I had a bad trip yesterday with Casamigos. I tried to jump out of a f*****n car on the highway. Blueface was keeping me from jumping out of the car. I thought that b***h was trying to get the f***k up out the car, but he was trying to save me. I just… blacked out.”&nbsp;</p><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 14: Chrisean Rock and Blueface attend Daniels Leather Fashion Show Blue Moon on September 14, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Johnny Nunez/WireImage)</p><span><h2 id=h-chrisean-rock-is-single>Chrisean Rock is Single</h2></span><p>As we reached&nbsp; the fourth quarter of 2022, people all over the world were guiltily entranced by the antics of Blueface and Chrisean to the extent that Zeus Network decided to green-light a reality show between the two. Known as Crazy In Love, the show took a typically exploitative view at their relationship and all the chaos&nbsp; that we’ve come to expect from television networks by this point.&nbsp;</p><p>Just days before the trailer dropped, Chrisean provided a fly in the ointment when she suggested that she’d severed ties to Blue once and for all, tweeting “Y’all can have him. ChriseanRock is single. Chrisean you are enough.“</p><p>Although the exact cause of what went down for the two to temporarily split is not yet known, she did reveal in that a fight between the two had turned incredibly volatile.&nbsp;“I almost went to jail, yo, I swear to God,” she said. “I broke everything in my hotel room in front of that n***a… The TV, the window… He had to run from that hotel to another.”</p><p>In the months since it happened, it is believed that the incident stemmed from Blueface’s sextape with another woman hitting the internet.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 id=h-january-2023-chrisean-has-a-meltdown-on-nojumper>January 2023: Chrisean Has a Meltdown On NoJumper&nbsp;</h2></span><p>As 2022 gave way to 2023, things only became even more incendiary between Blueface and Chrisean. During an appearance on the NoJumper podcast network, Chrisean was dragged kicking and screaming <a href=# rel>from the set as she called out for his assistance, breaking a TV in the process.&nbsp;</a></p><p>In the wake of the publicly broadcasted incident, Chrisean took to Instagram and gave fans an insight into where she was at.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s called a build up y’all don’t know what be happening behind closed doors straight up I’ll melt down every time I get a chance cuz dat shit hurt to my core.”&nbsp;</p><p>Once again, it appeared that the two were at a crossroads. But before long, a revelation would shake up their worlds.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 id=h-chrisean-rock-says-she-s-pregnant>Chrisean Rock Says She's Pregnant</h2></span><p>Just days on from the NoJumper incident, Chrisean revealed that she was expecting her first child. In an IG post, she shared three positive pregnancy tests alongside the caption, “guess how many heartbeats.”</p><p>While she naturally contended that Blueface was the father, he tried to dismiss her claims and suggested that the relationship had been formally concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>“To answer y’all questions yes me and rock are officially done it’s strictly business I tried it and clearly it wasn’t giving before she announces…she’s pregnant with somebody else’s child not mine. Rock has had encounters with 10 different men in the last year. until I see DNA test then it’s not mine," he added. “I know I know y’all thought she was all about me…me too lol but the facts are facts being my BM would be a blessing. She must be currently drinking while pregnant, that's a red flag. It’s not a Blueface baby.”</p><p>Just days on from the latest apparent full stop in their journey, they released the music videos for two new songs in “Lit” and “Dear Rock”, the latter of which showed them getting ‘married’ in the accompanying video.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 id=h-blueface-s-mom-claims-that-chrisean-is-not-pregnant>Blueface’s Mom Claims That Chrisean is Not Pregnant<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2></span><p>Just when you thought you’d seen the last wrinkle in this perplexing tale, Blueface’s mom has waded in to cast doubt over the authenticity of Chrisean’s pregnancy. After she was seen deadlift over 300lbs on Bradley Martyn’s channel alongside her beau, his mother took issue her behavior and suggested that the pregnancy was a ruse.&nbsp;</p><p>“Absolutely not pregnant,” she wrote over a repost of Martyn’s video. “That man would lose his license for allowing such an exercise.” For now, Chrisean has yet to respond, but we can only hope that it is resolved in a more peaceful manner than their previous interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Even as we prepare this timeline, Chrisean and Blueface remain steadfast in the news cycle, as they're not only entrenched in their own relationship drama, but in that of others - in recent days, <a href=# rel>the two have both taken (opposing) sides</a> when it comes to <a href=# rel>Rubi Rose's allegations against DDG</a>, who <a href=# rel>himself is currently in a relationship with Halle Bailey.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaH14gI9mmaWtlZuupLGMnJ%2BroaOarq950aiapKtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bq2MnKamqJyawaZ5x6Kqraeirg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./diane-sawyer-mike-nichols-love-story.html>&#171;&nbsp;Diane Sawyer and Mike Nichols' Enduring Love Story</a>
