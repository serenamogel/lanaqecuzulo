Also, peeking at her celebrity brother, she seems to live a comfortable life. Yet, her sources of income and net worth are missing just like <a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Kadima Selmani</strong></i></a>.</p><p>On the other hand, her brother JaMychal Green is a successful basketball player with a flourishing career. He is a multi-millionaire with total assets of<strong>&nbsp;$7 million</strong>. He earned a considerable amount of money through his sports career.</p><h2>Is Green Single? Also, Know Her Brother's Wedding Details:</h2><p>Well, Kemeche I. Green is a married woman living happily with her beloved husband without any worries. She is also a mother of one beautiful daughter.

He exchanged his vows with his wife on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2011</strong>. Though his marriage was held in a private ceremony, the world knew about his wedding after he announced himself as a "happily married man" on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the NBL star's wedding details, nothing is out on social media platforms. As a result, his girlfriend-turned-wife identity is also behind the curtains.&nbsp;</p><h2>NBL Star JaMychal Is A Proud Father To Three Children&nbsp;</h2><p>In JaMychal's family, including him and his wife, there are three other members, his children. From his married life, the NBL star became the father of a daughter named&nbsp;<strong>Jada Green </strong>on<strong> September 17, 2013</strong>. Moreover, when Jada was born, the proud father held his firstborn child in his arms.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, on&nbsp;<strong>April 8, 2019</strong>, JaMychal welcomed his son, <strong>Mike&nbsp;Jr. Green</strong>.

Her Instagram account goes by <a href=# rel=nofollow>@kgirl_01</a>, where she has achieved more than a hundred followers.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/11/15/unknown_294999941_5375131882530282_2009830083630972532_n%20(1)-min-1668503950026.jpg><p>Besides this, she is not active on other social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter.
