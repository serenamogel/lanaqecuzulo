Elvis Presley’s granddaughter is the product of the failed marriage between her parents, Lisa Marie Presley and Michael Lockwood who is a guitarist and music producer. Her mother is famous as a singer and also the only child of the Iconic American singer, Elvis Presley, and his ex-wife, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Priscilla Presley</a>, who was a businesswoman and actress.</p><p>Harper and her sister are the only children of Lockwood and are among the three surviving children of Marie Lisa who lost a son named Benjamin Keough.</p><p>As regards her ethnicity, Harper is of German, English, Norwegian, and Scots-Irish ancestry from her mother’s side. Her ethnic extraction from her father’s side remains unclear. However, she is American by nationality.</p><p>Born at the Los Robles Regional Medical Center, Thousand Oaks, California, in the United States, Harper spent her early life in Los Angeles where her mother pursued her singing career until her sad demise in 2023. It is also in Los Angeles that she continues to grow.</p><p>Harper’s parents got separated in 2016 and then they divorced in 2021.&nbsp;Before her parents parted ways, Harper and her sister who are believed to be inseparable lived a life away from the spotlight but their lives were forced to open up to the media during the sad divorce between their parents and the lengthy legal battles that followed. Subsequently, her mother ensured to give her daughters back their privacy by shielding them away from the media.</p><p>Details about Harper’s educational pursuits are not known but it is known that her older-half sister who was also brought up by Marie Lisa was once homeschooled. Hence, it is not clear if that is the same thing with Harper and her twin sister or if the two attended regular schools while with their mother.</p><h2><strong>The Marriage Between Her Parents Ended After 15 Years</strong></h2><p>Harper’s mum,&nbsp; Lisa Marie Presley, was not the most fortunate woman when it came to relationships. In her 54 years on earth, she was married four times. Her first marriage was to Danny Keough, and it ended after only 6 years. The next man she married was Michael Jackson in 1994 but by 1996, the marriage had already ended. She moved on to Nicolas Cage in 2002, but by 2004, she realized she wasn’t going to be third time lucky as the marriage ended after just 2 years.</p><p>It was after this divorce that she fell in love and later got married to Michael Lockwood in 2006. Initially, Presley’s relationship with Lockwood was on professional grounds as she hired him to serve as her musical director at a pay of $3,500 a week. The couple went public with their relationship in 2005 and Lisa was not slow in revealing that she felt she could spend the rest of her life with Lockwood.</p><p>Harper’s parents got married in 2006 and after only 2 years, she made it known that she was pregnant with their twins who were born in October 2008. For the better part of a decade later, it seemed as though the marriage was going to last forever, but in June 2016, Lisa Marie filed for divorce from Lockwood.</p><p>The couple remained separated until 2021 when the marriage was officially ended, 15 years after they tied the knot. The reason indicated in court documents for the divorce is irreconcilable differences.</p><p>In spite of the differences between their parents and while a long custody battle for the twin girls lasted, Harper and her sister <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>served as grooms-women</a> for their father in October 2022 during his Santa Barbara wedding to Stephanie Hobgood.</p><h2><strong>Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood’s Parents Got Locked In a Lengthy Custody Battle&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Right from 2016, Lisa and Michael were engulfed in a rather bitter custody battle on Harper and Finley. In the heat of the battle, Lockwood was investigated for alleged child abuse, and Lisa’s mother, Pricilla Presley claimed the kids were with her, until the custody battle was sorted out between their parents.</p><p>There was a rumor after Lisa filed for divorce that the kids were put in foster care, but their grandmother cleared the air that they were under her care and were having a great time. They were left with Priscilla Presley because Lisa checked into rehab as a result of drug addiction, and there was the aforementioned child abuse accusation hanging over their father.</p><p>The child abuse case against Lockwood came from Lisa who stated in the divorce papers she filed against her former husband that there were disturbing photos of children found on a computer that belonged to Michael Lockwood. Lisa Marie Presley stated that she was left horrified, shocked, and sick to the stomach when the alleged discoveries were made.</p><p>While Harper and her sister remained with their grandma, she revealed that both parents of the girls could see them until the court came to a decision.</p><p>When the custody battle came to an end in 2021 when the divorce of Lisa and Michael was finally granted, they were awarded shared custody of their twin girls. However, the guitarist asked that he be awarded $40,0000 spousal support from his former wife because what he made as a musician was very little.</p><p>In spite of the shared custody that he was offered with his former wife, it was reported that Michael Lockwood was not satisfied and so he continued fighting for more support even after he got married to the make-up artist, Stephanie Hobgood. The angst of the guitarist against the custody arrangement was that he was given only 40 percent custody of the two girls while his former wife was given the remaining 60 percent.</p><p>As part of the ruling, Presley was ordered to pay her former husband $4,641 per month in child support. This was arrived at after Lockwood claimed that he was without any major source of income, and was living with his mother and fiancée. Harper’s father claimed that he was depending on his mothers’ retirement funds to pay off debts while his ex-wife was making more than $238,000 per month from her father’s estate.</p><h2><strong>Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood</strong><strong> Has Three Siblings</strong></h2><p>Harper is one of the only two children from the marriage between her parents who gave birth to the youngster and her twin, Finley Aaron Love Lockwood. However, her mother had had two more kids from her previous marriages; Riley Keough and Benjamin Keough. Meet them:</p><h3><strong>Riley Keough</strong></h3><p>The oldest sibling of Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood is Riley Keough. She was born to Lisa Marie Presley and her first husband, Danny Keough. The marriage lasted from 1988 to 1994. Riley was born on 29 May 1989 which means she is currently 34 years old. She is an American actress who has more than 20 films to her credit. She’s been married to Ben Smith-Petersen since 2015.</p><p>Riley has a very close relationship with her sisters, Harper and Finley. It is reported that since the death of their mother, she has been very protective of her teenage sisters.</p><h3><strong>Benjamin Keough</strong></h3><p>The next of Harper’s siblings was Benjamin Keough. He was a product of Lisa’s marriage to Danny. Benjamin was born on 21 October 1992 in Tampa, Florida, and had a career as an actor until his death via suicide on 2 July 2020 in Calabasas, California. Benjamin was the only grandson of Elvis Presley.</p><h3><strong>Finley Aaron Love Lockwood</strong></h3><p>Harper’s last sibling is Finley Aaron Love Lockwood who was born her twin from her mothers’ aforementioned marriage to Michael Lockwood. Needless to say, Finely enjoys a great relationship with her sisters.</p><h2><strong>Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood Lost Her Mother in 2023</strong></h2><p>Harper and her sister as well as other family members were hit with a serious tragedy in January 2023 when her mum, Lisa Marie Presley, died. It was revealed that she suffered a cardiac arrest on the 12th and was taken to the hospital where she died.</p><p>At the time of her death, Harper and Finley were only 14 years old and Riley Keough was initially left with the responsibility of caring for the two girls being the oldest of the three sisters.</p><p>It is reported that she takes the task rather seriously, most especially as the family is cracked with her and her sisters on one side and Priscilla Presley and Michael Lockwood on the other side, as the family keeps control of Elvis Presley’s fortune worth over a hundred million dollars. It is reported that Riley is trying to do what is best for her twin sisters and protect them from the unending family drama.</p><p>While the loss of their mother has been a heavy blow for the sisters, Riley has done so much to help her sisters and protect them.</p><h2><strong>Who Has Custody of Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood Since Her Mother’s Death?</strong></h2><p>Before the death of Marie Lisa, Harper, and Finley were living with their mother. But considering their ages at the time of Lisa’s passing, there was the battle for their custody between their older half-sister, Riley Keough, and their father, Michael Lockwood who had the support of Priscilla Presley. The hopes of Riley who has always been protective of Harper and Finely were dashed when Michael Lockwood was given full de facto custody of the girls.</p><p>Michael Lockwood was granted full custody of the twin girls following a court hearing at the Los Angeles family court. While the ruling left Riley Keough devastated and furious for losing her sisters to someone she considered an outsider, the grandmother of the girls, Priscilla had no issues with it.</p><p>The ruling marked the end of the custody battle for the girls which lasted for six years. While it lasted, Michael was once quoted as saying it was going to be a cold day in hell before he would ever give up fighting to have the girls.</p><h2><strong>Lisa Left So Much For Harper and Her Sisters</strong></h2><p>With the death of Lisa, it came to light that Lisa left behind so much for Harper and her two other daughters. One of the most significant things Lisa left for her daughters is Elvis Presley’s Graceland estate which was left to her in trust when she lost her father at the age of 9 until she was 25 when the trust dissolved and she was given full ownership.</p><p>The King of Rock and Roll’s iconic estate which was left to Lisa after the passing of her father in 1977 has attracted many people some of whom spend the night. The 17,500 sq. ft. (1,626 sq. m) Tennessee estate is said to attract more than six hundred thousand visitors each year and it rakes in more than $10 million annually. It is estimated that the property to be inherited by Harper and her sisters is worth between $400 to $500 million.</p><p>She also left for her daughters life insurance which was reported to be around $35 million.</p><p>The inheritance has not come without causing a family feud between Harper’s older sister, Riley, and her grandmother, Priscilla Presley, as the latter wants to remain as a co-trustee for the estate as against what was discovered in the amended will of Lisa Marie which excluded Priscilla and her former business manager who were co-trustees. Priscilla has decided to challenge the amended will, pitching Riley, Harper, and Finely on one side while she stands on another.</p><h2><strong>What Does Lisa Marie Presley’s Daughter Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Harper Vivienne Ann Lockwood is now 15 years old but the career path she is interested in is not yet known to the public. This is because she has always preferred to stay away from the limelight.</p><p>There is hardly anything to suggest that she might be interested in following the musical career paths of either her father, grandfather, or her mother. More so, with her 34-year-old older sister, Danielle Riley Keough as a major force in her life at the moment, it still remains to be seen if she will follow in her path by becoming an actress.</p><p>Only time will tell what she may want for her career even as it is made known that the twin girls are lovers of ballet and Opera.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmoZmipbKzedWiraKdnqOybq3Np2Slp5OgxLC7w2ajoquRYrqivsieZKmqlai5psXSZpuarZedwaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./steve-j-palmer-bio-age-height-wife-net-worth-red-dead-redemption-2-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Steve J.
