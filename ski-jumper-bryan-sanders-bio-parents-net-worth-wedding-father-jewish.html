He is the father of Instagram personality Paige Sanders.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-net-worth-of-bryan-sanders></span>The Net Worth of Bryan Sanders<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>How rich is Bryan Sanders? As of late-2018, sources inform us of a net worth that is over $1 million, earned partly through a successful career in competitive ski jumping, and later from transitioning to a teaching career. As he continues his endeavors, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life></span>Early Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bryan’s father served in the military as a part of the 101st Airborne regiment, but otherwise very little information is known about Bryan’s childhood, or how he came to discover his passion for skiing. He did grow up in an area of the US that had cold and snowy winters, which exposed him more to winter related sports. According to several sources, he developed his love for skiing at a very young age which transitioned to him trying his hand at ski-jumping.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=ski-jumping></span>Ski Jumping<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ski-jumping is a winter sport in which participants descend from a ramp on their skis, the objective being to achieve the longest jump, but with style. The ramp is specifically designed to help with the jump, and there are numerous factors that affect each competitor’s score – jump length and style are among the few criteria for a high score. The sport began in the 19th century in Norway, and later spread to other parts of the world – it’s considered one of the traditional Nordic skiing disciplines. The competitors are required to reach a certain minimum target distance before other criteria are judged. Jumping technique has evolved somewhat over the years, with the original adoption of parallel skis with both arms pointing forward, to the modern style ski jumpers often use being the “V-style”, in which the skis are in a V position, with arms spread to the side. Ski jumping became a part of the Winter Olympics in 1924, and women’s participation in the sport began in 1990. All major ski jumping competitions are organized by the International Ski Federation. One of the best known modern competitors in the sport is Stefan Kraft, who holds the record for world’s longest ski jump at 253.5 meters or 832 feet, set in Vikersund in 2017. The sport also has a summer version with tracks made from porcelain.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=olympic-career></span>Olympic Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sanders started competing at a young age and worked his way up to be able to compete at the 1989 World Junior Championships. His performance there earned him a spot with the 1992 US Winter Olympic team, and he trained intensely to possibly win a medal during the high profile competition. He participated in three categories during the Olympics including Men’s Normal Hill – Individual in which he earned 38th ranking. He also participated in the Men’s Large Hill – Individual and achieved 36th ranking.</p><p>His best performance would be with the US in the team event on the Large Hill – Team category, finishing in a collective 12th place. However, the rankings was not enough for them to earn a medal, as there were numerous high skilled competitors from other countries during those games. After the Olympics, he continued his studies at St. Cloud State College, and two years later was inducted into the St. Paul Ski Club Hall of Fame.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=aftermath></span>Aftermath<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>With the media spotlight moving away from Bryan’s life after his Olympic run, he faded away from public view, and little information has been known or written about him since. However, his social media accounts do provide a bit of insight as to what he’s done after competitive ski jumping. He completed his education and then moved forward with a teaching career, still based in Minnesota. He did that for many years but eventually decided to go on a long break from teaching to focus on other endeavors.</p><p>He also married, though very little information is known about his wife and his family. It is known that he had a daughter from the marriage, who is said to have popularity on the social media website Instagram, where she lists herself as an influencer. However, her account cannot be searched online, so there is no proof to these statements. She is a student at Point Loma Nazarene University at California. Bryan still loves travelling, going outdoors, and photographing nature. After more than 18 years away from the school teaching system, he returned to work refreshed, and mentions that he enjoys it more now.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bryan-sanders-on-social-media></span>Bryan Sanders on Social Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the reasons why there is a bit of information about Sanders is due to his online activity. He has an account on the social media website Facebook, on which he posts some of his daily endeavors, interests, along with details about his family. He is still a big fan of sports despite retiring from it long ago, and is an avid follower of various professional baseball teams. He also continues to follow the professional skiing scene, having known people there that he also worked with back when he was younger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKubnnqrwcypnKtlkqfGorqMrJinnJWnwG6uyKhkqZmimru1v4ynnK1lp6S%2FtbSMsJydnJmjtG6ywK2fnqpdn7K4tdKhZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-eat-an-oreo-mit-study-news.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Ideal Way to Eat an Oreo, According to Scientists</a>
