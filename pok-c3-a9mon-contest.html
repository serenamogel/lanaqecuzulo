To raise a Pokémon's condition, Coordinators prepare <a href=# title=Pokéblock>Pokéblocks</a> of specific colors and feed them to their Pokémon.

Any Pokémon that won a Normal Rank contest may move up to the Super Rank in the same category. Likewise, a Super Rank winner can move up to the Hyper Rank, and a Hyper Rank winner can advance to the Master Rank in the same category.

In the first round, called the <a href=# title=Appeal>Performance Stage</a>, Coordinators have their Pokémon performing their <a href=# title=Move>moves</a> in order to showcase their style and skill.

The second round is the <a href=# title="Contest Battle">Battle Stage</a>, in which Coordinators compete in <a href=# title="Pokémon battle">Pokémon battles</a> while continuing to show off their Pokémon's style and skill. Each battle lasts five minutes and the object of the battle is to decrease the opponent's points. Coordinators lose points when their Pokémon are hit by an attack, when their Pokémon's attack fails, when the opponent's Pokémon performs a particularly appealing move, or when the opponent's Pokémon uses their Pokémon's attack to its own advantage. A battle can also end when one of the Pokémon is unable to battle, called <a href=# title=Fainting>Battle Off</a> by the judges. In this case, the Coordinator with the remaining Pokémon is declared the winner.</p><p>A Coordinator needs a <a href=# title="Contest Pass">Contest Pass</a> from a particular region to enter Pokémon Contests there.
