for the 28-year-old star of The Bear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The Emmy win is the latest accolade for Edebiri, who plays sous chef Sydney Adamu on

Edebiri won a Golden Globe Award for her role last week, as well as a Critics’ Choice Award on January 14. “I’m so incredibly grateful for this, for so many reasons,” she said during her acceptance speech, before addressing her parents in the audience. “I love you guys so much. Thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and Black and proud of all of that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Edebiri had to wait a long time to hear her name called. The Emmy Awards ceremony was originally scheduled for September but delayed because of the months-long actors and writers strikes.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Who Is Ayo Edebiri?" data-anchor-id=who-is-ayo-edebiri class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Who Is Ayo Edebiri?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Actor Ayo Edebiri is best known for her TV role as sous chef Sydney Adamu on the FX series The Bear, for which she won a 2024 Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy award. Prior to this breakout role, Edebiri performed as a standup comedian and worked as a writer for multiple television shows, including the Apple TV+ series Dickinson and the Netflix animated comedy Big Mouth. Edebiri received her first major acting opportunity in the latter as the voice of Missy. More recently, she starred in the 2023 teen comedy movie Bottoms with her collegiate friend and comedy collaborator, Rachel Sennott.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Ayo Edebiri<br>BORN: October 3, 1995<br>BIRTHPLACE: Boston, Massachusetts<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Libra</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Life and Education" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ayo Edebiri was born October 3, 1995, in Boston and grew up in the city’s Dorchester neighborhood. Both of her parents are immigrants to the United States, with her father originally from Nigeria and her mother from Barbados.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">An only child, Ayo was greatly influenced by religion while growing up. She attended a Pentecostal church with her family at least twice a week and told The New Yorker in June 2023 that the Bible helped spark her interest in storytelling. She frequently wrote stories in her journal and, by the time she was around 8 or 9 years old, drafted a fantasy novel about an orphan girl.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She then developed a passion for visual storytelling after watching Westerns with her father, including A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), both starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/clint-eastwood data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clint Eastwood" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Clint Eastwood</a>. But in terms of her future, “I didn’t really think of acting as a job that I could do.

Still, she fulfilled her creative instincts by performing improv during middle and high school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Edebiri attended predominantly white institutions and received her high school education at Boston Latin School, established in 1635 and now the oldest public school in the United States. Her parents encouraged her to study to become a teacher, and she enrolled at New York University. After two years, she began to reconsider her future. She switched her major to dramatic writing and began to perform stand-up comedy at the encouragement of her friend Rachel Sennott. By the time Edebiri graduated from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2017, she was determined to pursue a comedy career.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 title="Early Comedy and TV Writing Career" data-anchor-id=early-comedy-and-tv-writing-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Comedy and TV Writing Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduation, Edebiri remained in New York City and continued to perform stand-up routines.

She soon moved to Los Angeles and began writing for television shows such as the NBC sitcom Sunnyside, the FX comedy What We Do in the Shadows, and the Apple TV+ comedy-drama Dickinson, starring <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/hailee-steinfeld data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hailee Steinfeld" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Hailee Steinfeld</a> as a fictional version of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/emily-dickinson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Emily Dickinson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Emily Dickinson</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At one of her comedy sets, Edebiri had also drawn the attention of comedian Nick Kroll, co-creator of the Netflix animated series Big Mouth, an adult coming-of-age comedy about teenagers navigating puberty. “She was, like, 24, and already so in control of her voice,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kroll told The New Yorker" data-vars-ga-product-id=6504308f-97cd-4f7b-a123-e7d39f9071c1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-product-url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpersons-of-interest%2Fhow-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="Coralie Kraft" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1251410a-02b1-4b35-a90f-5abd9a690e7e data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Coralie Kraft" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">Kroll told The New Yorker</a>, and so he invited Edebiri to interview for a seat in the show’s writing room. Edebiri got the job and began writing for the show’s fifth season when the opportunity for an expanded role opened up.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 title="TV Shows" data-anchor-id=tv-shows class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">TV Shows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During the fourth season of Big Mouth in 2020, Edebiri began voicing the character Missy in her first major acting role. She took over the part from comedian Jenny Slate, who announced in June 2020 she would no longer voice Missy because the character was biracial yet she is white. “Black characters on an animated show should be played by Black people,” Slate wrote in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/CB1JlSqFXT8 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an Instagram post" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">an Instagram post</a>.

Unfortunately, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to The New Yorker" data-vars-ga-product-id=6504308f-97cd-4f7b-a123-e7d39f9071c1 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-product-url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/persons-of-interest/how-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fpersons-of-interest%2Fhow-ayo-edebiri-went-from-being-an-uncomfortable-child-to-a-star-of-the-bear" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand="Coralie Kraft" data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=1251410a-02b1-4b35-a90f-5abd9a690e7e data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="Coralie Kraft" class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">according to The New Yorker</a>, the casting decision made the actor and her parents the subject of harassment—leading Edebiri to remove information about her family from the internet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Despite this, she has voiced Missy through 32 episodes of the show and is expected to reprise the role for Big Mouth’s eighth and final season in 2024. A release date has not been announced,</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the success of Big Mouth, Edebiri began regularly appearing on camera as well.

She also played Hattie on six episodes of Dickinson in 2021 and had appearances in the anthology series The Premise (2021) and the HBO talk show Pause with Sam Jay (2022).
