Following her star turn in the 1954 musical Carmen Jones, she became the first African American to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. Dandridge found it difficult to replicate that success, and her final years were marred by personal and professional problems, until her death at age 42 in 1965.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life and Show Business</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dorothy Jean Dandridge was born on November 9, 1922, in Cleveland, Ohio. Her mother, actress Ruby Dandridge, left her husband while she was pregnant, and as such Dorothy never knew her father. She later suffered at the hands of her mother's girlfriend, Geneva Williams, a disciplinarian with a cruel side.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Pushed into show business at a young age by her mother, Dandridge performed with her sister, Vivian, as a song-and-dance team called the Wonder Children. The girls performed throughout the South, playing Black churches and other places.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sister Act and Intro to Hollywood</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around 1930, Dandridge moved to Los Angeles, California, with her family. A few years later she found success with her new musical group, the Dandridge Sisters, which included sister Vivian and their friend Etta Jones. The group landed gigs at the famous Cotton Club in Harlem and performed with top acts such as the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/cab-calloway-9235609 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cab Calloway" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Cab Calloway</a>. As an African American singer, Dandridge confronted early on the segregation and racism of the entertainment industry. She may have been allowed on stage, but in some venues, she couldn't eat in the restaurant or use certain facilities because of the color of her skin.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As a teenager, Dandridge began earning small roles in a number of films. She and her sister appeared in the Marx Brothers classic A Day at the Races (1937), as well as Going Places (1938), with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/louis-armstrong-9188912 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Louis Armstrong" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Louis Armstrong</a>. On her own, she danced with Harold Nicholas of the dancing Nicholas Brothers in the 1941 Sonja Henie musical Sun Valley Serenade. The duo's tap-dancing routine was cut from the version of the film shown in the South.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dandridge married Harold Nicholas in 1942, but their union proved to be anything but a happy one. Nicholas reportedly liked to chase other women, and Dandridge virtually retired from performing during this time. Adding to the strain, after Dandridge gave birth to daughter Harolyn in 1943, they discovered that the girl had brain damage. Seeking to find a cure, Dandridge had Harolyn receive expensive private care for many years.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Carmen Jones' and Stardom</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her divorce in 1951, Dandridge returned to the nightclub circuit, this time as a successful solo singer. After a stint at the Mocambo club in Hollywood with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/desi-arnaz-9542545 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Desi Arnaz" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Desi Arnaz</a>'s band and a sellout 14-week engagement at La Vie en Rose, she became an international star, performing at glamorous venues in London, Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco and New York. She won her first starring film role in 1953’s Bright Road, playing an earnest and dedicated young schoolteacher opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/harry-belafonte-12103211 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harry Belafonte" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Harry Belafonte</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her next role, as the eponymous lead in Carmen Jones (1954), a film adaptation of Bizet's opera Carmen that also co-starred Belafonte, catapulted her to the heights of stardom. With her sultry looks and flirtatious style, Dandridge became the first African American to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Although she lost out to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/grace-kelly-9362226 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Grace Kelly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Grace Kelly</a> (The Country Girl), Dandridge seemed well on her way to achieving the level of fame and superstardom enjoyed by white contemporaries like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/marilyn-monroe-9412123 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marilyn Monroe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marilyn Monroe</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/ava-gardner-9306531 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ava Gardner" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ava Gardner</a>. In 1955, she was featured on the cover of Life magazine and was treated like visiting royalty at that year’s Cannes Film Festival.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Later Roles and Personal Struggles</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, in the years that followed her success with Carmen Jones, Dandridge had trouble finding film roles that suited her talents. She wanted strong leading roles but found her opportunities limited because of her race. According to The New York Times, Dandridge once said, "If I were Betty Grable, I could capture the world." Belafonte also addressed this issue, noting that his former co-star "was the right person in the right place at the wrong time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Hollywood filmmakers unable to create a suitable role for the light-skinned Dandridge, they soon reverted to subtly prejudiced visions of interracial romance. She appeared in several poorly received racially and sexually charged dramas, including Island in the Sun (1957), also starring Belafonte and Joan Fontaine, and Tamango (1958), in which she plays the mistress of the captain of an enslaved ship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among the missed opportunities from this period, Dandridge turned down the supporting role of Tuptim in The King and I (1956), because she refused to play an enslaved person. It was rumored that she would play <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/billie-holiday data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Billie Holliday" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Billie Holliday</a> in a film version of the jazz singer's autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues, but it never panned out. Dandridge did appear in one more role worthy of her talents, opposite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/sidney-poitier-9443345 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sidney Poitier" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Sidney Poitier</a> in the Academy Award-winning Porgy and Bess (1959).</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While making Carmen Jones, Dandridge became involved in an affair with the film's director, Otto Preminger, who also directed Porgy and Bess. Their interracial romance, as well as Dandridge's relationships with other white lovers, was frowned upon, particularly by other African American members of the Hollywood filmmaking community. On the rebound, Dandridge married her second husband, Jack Denison, in 1959, though that proved to be another troubled relationship. Denison was abusive and mishandled her money, with Dandridge losing much of her savings to an investment in her husband's failed restaurant. They split in 1962.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As her film career and marriage floundered, Dandridge began drinking heavily and taking antidepressants. The threat of bankruptcy and nagging problems with the IRS forced her to resume her nightclub career, but she found only a fraction of her former success. Relegated to second-rate lounges and stage productions, Dandridge's financial situation grew increasingly worse. By 1963, she could no longer afford to pay for her daughter's 24-hour medical care, and Harolyn was placed in a state institution. Dandridge soon suffered a nervous breakdown.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On September 8, 1965, Dandridge was found dead in her Hollywood home at age 42. Initially reported to be the result of an embolism, additional findings pointed to an overdose of an antidepressant. Dandridge had little more than $2 in her bank account at the time of her death.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Dandridge's unique and tragic story became the subject of renewed interest in the late 1990s, beginning in 1997 with the release of a biography, Dorothy Dandridge, by Donald Bogle, and a two-week retrospective at New York City's Film Forum. In 2000, film star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/people/halle-berry-9542339 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Halle Berry" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Halle Berry</a> won Golden Globe and Emmy awards for her portrayal of the groundbreaking actress in the acclaimed TV movie, Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10"></h2><ul data-node-id=39 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Dorothy Dandridge</li><li>Birth Year: 1922</li><li>Birth date: November 9, 1922</li><li>Birth State: Ohio</li><li>Birth City: Cleveland</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Actress and singer Dorothy Dandridge was the first African American to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.</li><li>Industries</li><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Dorothy Dandridge was the first African American to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.</li></ul><li>Death Year: 1965</li><li>Death date: September 8, 1965</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: West Hollywood</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=43><ul data-node-id=45 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Dorothy Dandridge Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/actor/dorothy-dandridge</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 19, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=49 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>America was not geared to make me into a Liz Taylor, a Monroe, a Gardner.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYnKyfp8BwsM6rpq2gqWKxorrDq6Cdn5U%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./what-oil-is-best-for-scrambled-eggs.html>&#171;&nbsp;What oil is best for scrambled eggs?</a>
