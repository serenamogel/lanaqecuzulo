Coleen Rooney has a height of 1.6m.</p><p>In her early life, Coleen was born to Tony and Colette McLoughlin in a family of Irish descent. Her father, Tony McLoughlin, worked as a bricklayer and also ran a boxing club. She is the eldest of four children, with a younger sister named Rosie, who tragically passed away on January 5, 2013, at the age of 14. Coleen’s upbringing was rooted in her hometown of Liverpool.</p><p>For her education, Coleen Rooney attended St. John Bosco Arts College and completed her schooling with outstanding academic achievements. She obtained 10 GCSEs, including an A* in Performing Arts, demonstrating her early aptitude and talent.</p><p>Coleen’s career in the public eye began with her contributions as a columnist for the celebrity magazine “Closer.” Her column, titled “Welcome to My World,” allowed readers to get a glimpse into her life and experiences. In 2008, she transitioned to writing a weekly fashion and news column for “OK!” magazine, broadening her reach and influence.</p><p>One significant moment in Coleen’s early career was her involvement in presenting television programs. In May 2006, she worked alongside Sir Trevor McDonald on his show “Tonight with Trevor McDonald,” focusing on raising awareness about Rett syndrome, a genetic disorder that her younger sister had battled. Her passion for promoting important causes was evident in her work on the program.</p><p>In addition to her TV appearances, Coleen created her own series titled “Coleen’s Real Women” for ITV. This show earned her the title of “The nation’s favorite girl next door” as she sought to discover “real women” to represent advertising campaigns as an alternative to professional models. Her genuine and relatable approach resonated with viewers.</p><p>Coleen Rooney’s influence extended to the world of fitness and fashion. In December 2005, she released an exercise DVD called “Coleen McLoughlin’s Brand New Body Workout,” which became a bestseller in the UK. Her prominence in the fashion world was further solidified when she secured a £3 million deal to front the George at Asda campaign.</p><p>Her writing talents were not limited to columns and magazine contributions. Coleen authored her autobiography, titled “Welcome to My World,” which was released in March 2007. The following year, she published “Coleen’s Real Style” with HarperCollins. She also ventured into the world of publishing with a four-book series called “Coleen Style Queen,” which spanned from 2008 to 2010.</p><p>Outside of her professional life, Coleen Rooney’s personal life is well-documented. She first crossed paths with her future husband, Wayne Rooney, at the young age of 12 in the Liverpool suburb of Croxteth. Their love story began when they were 16 years old, shortly after finishing secondary school. Notably, Wayne’s mother, Jeanette, worked part-time as a cleaner at St. John Bosco Arts College, the same school Coleen attended.</p><p>The couple’s love story culminated in marriage. On June 12, 2008, they tied the knot in a picturesque ceremony in Portofino, Italy. The wedding was exclusive to OK! magazine, which reportedly paid them £2.5 million for the privilege of sharing their wedding details and photographs with the world. This newlywed couple, affectionately referred to as “Wayleen,” resided in a beautiful £1.3 million mansion in Formby.</p><p>Prior to their move to the United States, where Wayne pursued his career as a player and manager for D.C. United, the Rooneys lived in Prestbury, Cheshire, in a stunning £4 million neo-Georgian mansion.</p><p>Family plays a central role in Coleen’s life. She and Wayne Rooney are proud parents to four sons, born in 2009, 2013, 2016, and 2018, respectively. These young additions have brought joy and fulfillment to their family life.</p><p>Coleen Rooney is also involved in philanthropy. She serves as a patron of the Liverpool-based Alder Hey Children’s Charity, demonstrating her commitment to giving back to her community and supporting important causes.</p><p>In recent years, Coleen Rooney became embroiled in a high-profile dispute with fellow WAG (Wives and Girlfriends of professional footballers) Rebekah Vardy. The controversy, popularly known as ‘Wagatha Christie,’ unfolded in October 2019. Coleen took to Twitter to explain that her private Instagram posts were being leaked to The Sun newspaper.</p><p>To identify the source of the leaks, she limited access to these posts to only one account, which belonged to Rebekah Vardy. This public revelation sparked a legal battle between the two personalities, with Vardy suing Rooney for defamation. In the end, a court ruling favored Vardy, but the legal dispute continued with Rooney aiming to prove the truth of her allegations.</p><p>As of July 2022, Mrs. Justice Steyn dismissed Vardy’s claim, ruling that Coleen Rooney’s accusation was “substantially true,” bringing an end to the legal battle.</p><p>In conclusion, Coleen Rooney’s life and career have been marked by her early achievements as a television personality and her subsequent roles as an author, philanthropist, and influential public figure. Her enduring love story with Wayne Rooney and her dedication to their family life remain a significant part of her identity. Coleen’s willingness to stand up for what she believed to be right, as exemplified in the ‘Wagatha Christie’ case, further underscores her commitment to her principles.</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ghgossip.com</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpympZ2Vo3qzu86nnLJlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGcsm60xKKeoaxf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kollam-sudhi-age-height-weight.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kollam Sudhi Age, Height, Weight</a>
